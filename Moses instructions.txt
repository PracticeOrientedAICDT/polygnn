So I installed python3.8 on Ubuntu with the following commands:

    sudo apt install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3.8

(I recommend looking up how to install python3.8 on macos)

I followed up by installing poetry, which can be done with pip

    pip install poetry

And then I followed the instructions as described on github

    whereis python3.8                   # to find the path
    poetry env use /path/to/python3.8
    poetry install                      # in the root file of the project
    poetry poetry run poe torch-osx.    # or poetry run poe torch-linux_win-cuda102 for me

For the last line I had issues and if it doesn't work I'd recommend 

    poetry run pip install torch_geometric
    poetry run pip install --no-index torch-scatter -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.12.0+cpu.html
    poetry run pip install --no-index torch-sparse -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-1.12.0+cpu.html
