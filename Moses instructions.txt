I have poetry and brew but couldn't install python 3.7 like they suggest so I used conda:

    conda create -n polygnn python=3.7

Once inside the enviroment (conda activate polygnn) I tried to run poetry install but poetry had issues, so I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling it :)

    pip uninstall poetry
    pip install poetry==1.5.1
    cd path/to/file
    poetry install

It took a couple of tries to install packages with poetry. No clue why. If you're stuck try running:
    pip install poetry-core


I changed the windows command to look for torch 1.10.2+cu102        rather than 1.12.1+cu102
                            and same with torchvision 0.11.3+cu102  rather than 0.13.1+cu102
                                      and torchaudio 0.10.2         rather than 0.12.1

I ran the next command as per the README instructions and the last one did not work so I ran
    pip install torch_geometric==2.0.0


NONE OF THIS WORKED :(
